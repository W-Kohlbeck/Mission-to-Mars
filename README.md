# Mission-to-Mars

## Summary  
For this project the goal was to scrape mulitple sites using Splinter and Beautiful Soup. The information was then gathered and displayed using Flask. The resulting web app has the functionality to scrape the new sites with the click of a button, and then display the new contents in the updated home screen.
